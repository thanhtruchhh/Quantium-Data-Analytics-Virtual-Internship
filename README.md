# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship
This repository contains results of the completed tasks for the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program by Forage, designed to replicate life in the Retail Analytics and Strategy team at Quantium, using Python. 

## Project Overview

This virtual experience program involves analysing chip purchases at supermarkets. The aim of this project was to evaluate different customers' purchasing behaviours and the performance of trial stores with a new layout to provide insights of customer preferences to the client and a recommendation of whether the trial has been successful.

This project consists of 3 tasks:
* Task 1 - Data preparation and customer analytics: Analyze client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviors to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.
* Task 2 - Experimentation and uplift testing: Extend your analysis from Task 1 to help you identify benchmark stores that allow you to test the trial store layouts' impact on customer sales.
* Task 3 - Analytics and commercial application: Use analytics and insights from Task 1 and 2 to prepare a report for your client, the Category Manager.
